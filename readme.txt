Create and store profiles on all your ships/boats along with logs of every outing and adventure

== Description ==

Easy and detailed management of all the ships/boats in your inventory. 
Allows you to track all vital statistics related to an individual boat.

Log entries can be created and attached to any ship in your inventory. 
The log is modeled after the traditional ship log, with the additional flair provided by the internet
to expand capabilities to post images, files, etc. 

Pre-created template view files are included so you can get your ship log running right out of the box.
These templates can be overridden in the theme directory, giving you full control over the look and feel
of your ship log.
